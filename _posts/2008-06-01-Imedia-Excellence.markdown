In this Ad campaign, a supposed friend of Grazi Mazzafera - Brazilian Actress - speaks with the site visitor while she is interrupted by Grazi's call. Following the shot, the visitor had to input his cellphone number, and suddenly the visitor receives a call from Grazi. A successful campaign which generated more than 21.000 calls in its first day, 1.000 positive prints, and had more than 1 million access without any media investment. As result of this pioneer campaign, the agency was awarded with website of the year and best use of digital media.
